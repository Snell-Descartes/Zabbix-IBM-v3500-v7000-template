# Zabbix-IBM-v3500-v7000-template
Use for monitoring of IBM v3500, v3700 and v7000 storage systems within Zabbix.

Supports multiple enclosures and monitors power supplies, vdisks, arrays, canisters and disks.

Adapted from the original script created by Francisco Tudel 2015

To use simply:
* copy the v3700_status.sh file to /usr/lib/zabbix folder on your zabbix server.
* Import the template file into your templates section within the Zabbix ui.
* Create a new user on your storage system which Zabbix can use.
* Then create your host as per mornal but adding the following user macros:
* {$CABIP1} - this is the IP address or the fqdn/hostname of your storage system
* Setup a SSH Key-Based Authentication in the script execution environment. 

Then execute the 4 discovery rules, which should then populate all the items you need for monitoring.
